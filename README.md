# self-sovereign-identity
Articles and documents associated with designing and implementing identity technology using self-sovereign identity principles

This is a Draft Branch of [my fork](https://github.com/infominer33/self-sovereign-identity) of [/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity)

This is just a temporary workspace while I organize some thoughts around the [Evolution of Self Sovereign Identity](evolution-of-ssi.md). My intention is to collect and highlight thought on SSI since 2016, and highlight a few needs as I see them. Once I've completed a review of literature on the subject, I'll put it into a google shared doc for collaboration with whoever is interested.
